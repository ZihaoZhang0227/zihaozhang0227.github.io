                    </h2>
                    <p>a) When I first opened the website, I found a black guide interface. This guide interface made
                        mefeel like a curtain, slowly pulling the page away.</p>
                    <p>b) Then came a series of carousels that introduced the recent activities of NGV.</p>
                    <p>c) Here I noticed the upper navigation bar of NGV, which shows the most basic information about
                        entering NGV, such as how to buy tickets, etc.</p>
                    <p>d) I started to enlarge the page to full screen, and I found that NGV's website adopts a
                        relatively basic page layout.</p>
                    <p>e) I started to scroll down the page and it felt good to me. Each story displayed is divided into
                        small areas, and with a gradient effect, it feels very soft.</p>
                    <p>f) Swipe to the bottom, and there are many humanized consultation questions.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>In the whole experience, the first thing that caught my eye was the carousel image when the page
                        was opened. The images that are constantly cross converted here are images with higher
                        saturation, which makes it easy for the audience to see the information at a glance. This is
                        also what you need to do to make a web page. Try to let the audience see what they want to know
                        at first glance. If it is too complicated, it will consume users' money.</p>

                    <p>The multilingual system of this site is very disappointing. The English version of the website not only has the introduction of the event, but also the introduction of the artist, rich in color matching. However, only the English-only part of the site is very interactive, and other languages have only a few thin pages. When I browsed the site in Japanese, I found that only the first page was in Japanese, and all the secondary pages jumped back to English.</p>

                    <p>What I like most about this page is that there is so much useful information in it. This mainly depends on the effective layout of the page. There will not be too many words to consume the patience of users. In addition, the effective layout and the side-by-side arrangement of pictures and words are all I can learn from.</p>
