	<!-- In the fourth connection I chose to make a music video.This music video brings the audience both visual and auditory enjoyment, the combination of changing background and electronic music looks even more dreamy. On this basis I added four new functions.

    1. The first is a draggable progress bar. I think from the perspective of an audience, and I would very much like to be able to flexibly adjust the picture I want to see or listen to. Secondly, the movement of the progress bar will give me a better understanding of where the video has been played, and I can freely control my own time, which is a great feature.

    2. Second, I added the function of volume adjustment. Volume adjustment is also a must-have element in video. Users can freely control the volume of the video, and even mute it.

    3. Third, I additionally added full screen playback. This feature is more suitable for people to concentrate on watching a video and will provide a very immersive auditory and visual experience. Bring more impact and leave a deeper impression.

    4. Fourth, I added a button with a background color adjustment. This feature is what I came up with when I watched a video one night and found that the background color was too bright to be more immersive. This button is located in the middle of the right border of the video. After clicking, it provides an immersive experience that is no less than full screen. For users, this interaction will be more interesting and will be a bonus point for making an impression. -->
